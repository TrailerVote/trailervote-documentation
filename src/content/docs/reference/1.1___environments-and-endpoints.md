In this documentation the base url includes `/api`, but our [configuration
endpoint](#) does *NOT* require it. The client **SHOULD** use the following base
endpoints to get the configuration:

|environment|configuration endpoint|
|-----------|----------------------|
|staging|https://staging.trailervote.com|
|production|[https://api.trailervote.com](https://api.trailervote.com)|

The **production** environment is currently not yet available.

All the environments and services share the [Request and Response Headers](request-and-response-headers).
