This section aims to give an overview of the headers API servers expect when receiving a request to an endpoint. To illustrate them we will start with some examples and will continue with an explanation per header.

## Example GET request

### Request

## Headers
### Host
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host

This is a default header, it should be set by default by your HTTP library

### User-Agent
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent

Please send us something descriptive. Preferably in the following format: `TrailerVote<something>/<version> (<something we can use to find the correct repository to file an issue>)`

### Authorization
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization

We use basic [authentication](authentication) on all services. You should have received a username and password for from us which you can give to your HTTP library. Read more about authentication [here](authentication).

### Accept
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept

This indicates what type of response you expect from the server. You can choose from the [media types](Media-Types) documented on this wiki.

All [media types](media-types) that have links describe which media types you can expect at the resources they link to. An example is the [`application/vnd.trailervote.configuration.v1+json`](media-type-configuration) media type which has a link to an endpoint that describes the Place this client belongs to. This link has the `application/vnd.trailervote.place.v1+json`(media-type-place) media type.

### If-None-Match
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match

This header is used for caching. Clients are encouraged to use them for `GET` requests if they already have a previously received ETag.

### Content-Type
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type

If you `PUT` or `POST` something to the API you should tell the server what [media type](media-types) you are sending it.

In the response from the server this indicates the media type of the body you receive. This might be different from the things you requested in the Accept header!

### Content-Location
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Location

If you `POST` or `PUT` something and get a `Content-Location`, this location indicates the full resource is represented, which can also be accessed by the URI in the header.

If you `GET` something and get a `Content-Location`, you **MAY** assume that for the current Content Negotiation (`Accept` etc headers) the URL is negotiated.

### If-Match
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Match

If you update a resource by `PUT`ing a changed version back you need to tell the server the ETag of the version you based the change on. If you don't have an ETag yet you can issue a `GET` or a `HEAD` request to the same url.

We use this to ensure multiple clients don't accidentally overwrite each others changes.

### ETag
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag

This is a value describing the version of the resource you just requested.

### Allow
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Allow

With each request the server will send the allowed methods of that url. If this list contains a `PUT` you are allowed to update the resource, if it contains a `DELETE` you can delete it. The behavior of the `POST` method is [media type](media-types) specific.

### Warning
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Warning

A warning usually indicates that something works right now but will stop working in the near future. Clients should show a prompt for each warning to the user if the app is in debug mode.
