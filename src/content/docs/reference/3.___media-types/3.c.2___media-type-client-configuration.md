```
application/vnd.trailervote.client_configuration.v1+json
```

The client configuration media type is used when a client, such as the SDK clients, want to configure the TrailerVote services. When accepted, the TrailerVote services may use the passed configurations to return specific responses based on that configuration. For example, the [configuration](media-type-configuration) from the root endpoint changed based on the values.

## Schema
```Ruby
"client_configuration" do
  attribute :place, String
  attribute :persona, String
end
```

## Attributes

| attribute |   |
|-----------|---|
| place | A fully qualified url to the place. |
| persona | A fully qualified url to the persona. You can use the templated url from [configuration](media-type-configuration) to construct this url. |
