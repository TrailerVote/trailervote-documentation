application/vnd.trailervote.client_configuration.v1+json
```

The client configuration media type is used when a client, such as the SDK clients, want to configure the TrailerVote services. When accepted, the TrailerVote services may use the passed configurations to return specific responses based on that configuration. For example, the [configuration](media-type-configuration) from the root endpoint changed based on the values.

## Schema
```ruby
attribute :configuration do
  attribute :place, String
  attribute :persona, String
end
```

## Format
```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "persona": "https://fake.trailervote.com/api/personas/uuidv4",
    "place": "https://fake.trailervote.com/api/places/uuidv4"
  }
}
```

## Attributes

| attribute |   |
|-----------|---|
