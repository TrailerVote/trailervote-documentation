```
application/vnd.trailervote.errors.v1+json
```

All errors given back to any TrailerVote service have this media type. In order to ensure correct error content-type negotiation, clients SHOULD include the media type with a reduced quality param q in the Accept header of each request. The RECOMMENDED value for q is 0.1.

```
Accept: application/vnd.trailervote.type, text/html; q=0.8, application/vnd.trailervote.errors.v1+json; q=0.1
```

## Format
```
errors: [
  { message: "an error message", code: "AxErrorCode" },
  { message: "another error message", code: "GxErrorCode" },
  { ... },
  ...
]
```
The top level key `errors` is always present, and within you may find at least one error object. We can map the code back to a original error class. Together with the HTTP status code, this *SHOULD* give you enough information how to resolve or proceed. Some services don't (yet) include a `code`, and in case of issues you should inspect the error message to figure out how to fix the issue.

## Common errors

### 400 Bad Request
|code / source|reason|
|----|------|
|`Gx6bd4d961d4e1410da5c658256a1fe4f8` `OptimisticallyStale::MissingLockVersion`|The update request is missing the `lock_version` parameter|
|`Gxad6f687436aca6eeb1c67edede69a97d` `ActionController::BadRequest`|The request has malformed parameters or its body does not match the supplied `Content-Type`
|`Gxa1b5b80bd77862cc0c0d95d76ee87a3c` `ApiController::RequestMissingParam`|Expected a param to be present in query or body of request.|

You can solve these errors by inspecting your request. Make sure the `Content-Type` matches the body's content, if any.

### 403 Forbidden

|`Gx8b0434ef639d736a317d228fd308afec` `NothingAccessibleBy`|You are not authorized to access anything in a complex association|

If you can see a resource, you may utilize the [Allow Header](request-and-response-headers#allow) to determine which capabilities are authorized.

### 409 Conflict

### 410 Gone
|code / source|reason|
|----|------|
