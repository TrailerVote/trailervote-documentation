Products are all things that are the subject of Audio Fragments (advertisements, trailers, sound bites). This can be a book; a movie; a car; a drink; anything that would be a product in the real world. Recognition is done on the audio fragments, not on products directly.

A product has attachments, such as data, images, and recognizable audio fragments.

## Schema (v2)

```Ruby
attribute 'product' do
  attribute :name, String
  attribute :description, AllowNil(String)
  attribute :updated_at, String
  attribute :lock_version, Numeric

  collection :product_identifiers do
    attribute :authority, String

  collection :data do

          attribute :name, AllowNil(String)
          attribute :description, AllowNil(String)
