Products are all things that are the subject of Audio Fragments (advertisements, trailers, sound bites). This can be a book; a movie; a car; a drink; anything that would be a product in the real world. Recognition is done on the audio fragments, not on products directly.

A product has attachments, such as data, images, and recognizable audio fragments.

## Schema

```Ruby
"product" do
  attribute :name, String
  attribute :description, AllowNil(String)
  attribute :updated_at, String
  attribute :lock_version, Numeric

  collection :product_identifiers do
    attribute :authority, String
    attribute :identifier, String
  end

  collection :data do
    any do
      attribute :type, String
      attribute :type_version, Numeric

      collection :translations, allow_empty: true do
        any do
          attribute :name, AllowNil(String)
          attribute :description, AllowNil(String)
        end
      end

      not_strict
    end
  end

  collection :raw_data do
    any do
      not_strict
    end
  end

  link :self
  link :images
  link :videos
  link :places
  link :audio_fragments
end
```
