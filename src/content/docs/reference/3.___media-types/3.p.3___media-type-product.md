Products are all things that are the subject of Audio Fragments (advertisements, trailers, sound bites). This can be a book; a movie; a car; a drink; anything that would be a product in the real world. Recognition is done on the audio fragments, not on products directly.

A product has attachments, such as data, images, and recognizable audio fragments.
