```

The product lookup is used to find products by means of an authority and identifier. An identifier **MUST** be unique for that authority.

> For example, on TMDb each movie has (at least) one identifier, but no two movies share a TMDb identifier.

Each product on TrailerVote can have any number of authority-identifier pairs, and a client **SHOULD** lookup a product which each pair known simultaneously.

> For example, many movies on TMDb are also on IMDB and have an IMDB identifier.

## Schema

```ruby
collection :product_identifiers, force: nil do
  attribute :authority, String
  attribute :identifier
end
```
