```

A Persona is a uniquely identified person / a unique device. When someone uses the SDK, the client MUST generate a UUID v4 and use that as Persona. This allows the API to link Feedback on Audio Fragments to a Persona, and MAY act as likes/dislikes (interests/disinterests).

## Schema
```ruby
attribute :persona do
  attribute :id, UuidV4
  link :self
  link :feedback
end
```

## Format
```json
{
  "persona": {
    "id": "uuidv4",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "https://fake.trailervote.com/api/personas/uuidv4"
      },
      "feedback": {
        "href": "https://fake.trailervote.com/api/personas/uuidv4"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
