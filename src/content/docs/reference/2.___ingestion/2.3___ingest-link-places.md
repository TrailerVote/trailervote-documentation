> Before you read this, please check the [ingestion guide preface](ingestion).

## Finding the root place
The `root` place is the top level place attached to your client credentials. Anything below this top level place is accessible by your client(s). For example, your Android, iOS and ingestion credentials all have access to the same `root` place.

The root place is linked to the [configuration](media-types-configuration), on the `place` link.

| language |  |
|----------|---|
| Ruby | `trailer_vote/api/place/find` |
| JavaScript | `trailervote-api/place/find` |

## Attach product to place

If your product is available at all locations, or if you don't use location/place filtering, attach the newly created product (or updated product) to the `root` place:

```
> POST https://example.trailervote.com/api/products/c0782ddc-5926-4d6b-94e1-a3bcaadd867f/places
> Accept: application/vnd.trailervote.product_place_link.v1+json, application/vnd.trailervote.errors.v1+json; q=0.1
> Content-Type: application/vnd.trailervote.product_place_link.create.v1+json
>
> { "place": "https://example.trailervote.com/api/places/3a6b8ad6-ce3c-4382-8e7c-092611075304 }
```

If you're using one of the [packages](ingestion), use:

| language |  |
|----------|---|
| Ruby | `trailer_vote/api/product/place/link` |
| JavaScript | `trailervote-api/product/place/link` |

## Creating a new place

New places can only be created as child of a known, accessible place, for example the `root` place.

| language |  |
|----------|---|
| Ruby | `trailer_vote/api/place/create` |
| JavaScript | `trailervote-api/place/create` |
