## Product Lookup

Getting products or updates to products into the TrailerVote eco system starts with a lookup in order to get any current data. Lookups are done on `authority:identifier` pairs as defined in the [product.lookup media type](media-type-product-lookup). The endpoint for a product lookup is included in the [configuration](media-type-configuration).

> As per the [API  design considerations](/reference), clients **SHOULD** never need to do any string manipulation except for those using URI templates. The [configuration media type](media-type) **SHOULD** be used on the root of the [environment's endpoint](environments-and-endoints). It returns both the required `product_lookup` and `products` [HTTP Link](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288#section-3.5).

If you're using one of the [packages](ingestion), use:

| language |  |
|----------|---|
| Ruby | `TrailerVote::Api::Product::Lookup` |
| JavaScript | `trailervote-api/product/lookup` |

### Example

```
> POST https://example.trailervote.com/products/lookup
> Accept: application/vnd.trailervote.product.v2+json, application/vnd.trailervote.errors.v1+json; q=0.1
> Content-Type: application/vnd.trailervote.product.lookup.v1+json
>
> {
>   "product_identifiers": [
>     { "authority": "tmdb", "identifier": "284054" },
>     { "authority": "imdb", "identifier: "tt1825683" }
>   ]
> }
```

If this movie already exists in TrailerVote (and it most likely does), you will get back a `302 Found` with a `Location` to the product endpoint, which `Accept`s the [product media type](media-type-product).

In case this movie does not exist, you get a 404 Not Found with the [error media type](media-type-errors):

```

<       "code": "Gxf413eb482deef440f00469efc6caaf46"
<     }
<   ]
< }
```

## Normalise data

In order to ingest the movie into the TrailerVote ecosystem, the data needs to be normalised. The schema for `data` is defined by the [product media type](media-type-product). Given that this a movie, the following attributes need to be determined:

| attribute      | description |
|----------------|-------------|
| type           | `"movie"`   |
| type_version   | 1        |
| translations   | a set of translations, keyed on ISO 639-1 code or [accepted value](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-2.1) |
| > name         | the name of this movie, in this language |
| > description  | the description of this movie, in this language |
| genres         | an array of string denoting the genres of this movie |
| run_time       | run time in minutes as a number |
| mpaa_rating    | the mpaa rating |
| release_date   | an ISO date string for the original release date |

TrailerVote is aware that the MPAA Rating may differ per release region and that the Release Date may differ per region or even per location/place. Currently there is no support for localised MPAA Ratings or Release dates, but the suggested values are the original/country of origin values.

> TrailerVote holds two types of data: normalised data and raw data. The normalised data is used by other systems and the structure under TrailerVote's control. The raw data stays untouched and does not need to be in any particular format.

### Example

```
{
  "data": {
    "tmdb": {
      "type": "movie",
      "type_version": 1,
      "translations": {
          "en-US": {
              "name": "Black Panther",
              "description": "King T'Challa returns home from America to the reclusive, technologically advanced African
              nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader. However, T'Challa soon finds that he is challenged
              for the throne by factions within his own country as well as without. Using powers reserved to Wakandan
              kings, T'Challa assumes the Black Panther mantel to join with girlfriend Nakia, the queen-mother, his
              princess-kid sister, members of the Dora Milaje (the Wakandan 'special forces') and an American secret
              agent, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war."
          }
      },
      "genres": [
          "action",
          "adventure",
          "fantasy",
          "science fiction"
      ],
      "mpaa_rating": "PG-13",
      "run_time": 134,
      "release_date": "2018-02-13",
    }
  }
}
```

## Create or Update product

When the data is normalised, and the product identifiers are identified, based on the current existence, the product can either be created, using the `.create` variant of the [product media type](media-type-product) on the `products` link as given by the [configuration](media-type-configuration), or updated with the regular variant of the [product media type](media-type-product) on the `self` link of that product.

### Create

Creating the product can be achieved with a `POST` request on the `products` link from the [configuration](media-type-configuration).

If you're using one of the [packages](ingestion), use:

| language |  |
|----------|---|
| Ruby | `TrailerVote::Api::Product::Create` |
| JavaScript | `trailervote-api/product/create` |

```
> POST https://example.trailervote.com/api/products
> Accept: application/vnd.trailervote.product.v2+json, application/vnd.trailervote.errors.v1+json; q=0.1
> Content-Type: application/vnd.trailervote.product.create.v1+json
>
> {
>   "product": {
>     "name": "Black Panther",
>     "data": {
>       "tmdb": {
>          ...
>       }
>     },
>     "raw_data": {
>       "tmdb": {
>         ...
>       }
>     }
>     "product_identifiers": [
>       { "authority": "tmdb", "identifier": "284054" },
>       { "authority": "imdb", "identifier: "tt1825683" }
>     ]
>   }
> }
```

If correctly created, the response is a `201 Created` with a `Location` to the created product.

Creation can yield many errors, most common ones are listed in the [errors documentation](media-type-errors). If the product was inadvertently created between the lookup and this call, you get a `409 Conflict`. In this case, the recommended action is to rerun the ingestion for this product in order to merge local data with the existing product.

### Update

If a product already exists, it can be updated using a `PUT` request on the `self` link.

If you're using one of the [packages](ingestion), use:

| language |  |
|----------|---|
| Ruby | `TrailerVote::Api::Product::Update` |
| JavaScript | `trailervote-api/product/update` |

```
> PUT https://example.trailervote.com/api/products/c0782ddc-5926-4d6b-94e1-a3bcaadd867f
> Accept: application/vnd.trailervote.product.v2+json, application/vnd.trailervote.errors.v1+json; q=0.1
> Content-Type: application/vnd.trailervote.product.v1+json
> If-Match: W/"28edc3186eadf47263f15ea930b0233b"
>
> {
>   "product": {
>     "name": "Black Panther",
>     "description": "Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who returns home to the isolated, technologically

>     ],
>     "_links": {
>       ...
>     }
>   }
> }
```

As defined by the [headers](request-and-response-headers), the `If-Match` is required when updating a resource. In addition to the `ETag` as `If-Match` value, you **MUST** return any unmodified field as unchanged, including the `lock_version`. If you do not return all fields, you might get any error such as a `400 Bad Request` or a `403 Forbidden`.

If the resource was updated between the lookup and the update call, either a `412 Precondition Failed` or `409 Conflict` is returned. The recommended action is to rerun the ingestion for this product in order to merge local data with the existing product. Other common errors are listed in the [error documentation](media-type-errors).
