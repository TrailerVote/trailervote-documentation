categories: ['reference', 'api', 'configuration']

All requests that require authentication have `Basic Authentication.` A consumer
is someone who consumes the API, provided by a producer (e.g. the Product
service), i.e. a client. Each consumer has its own set of credentials, which has
its own set of authorized actions.

In order to simplify authorization for the means of this document, we recognize
there are three buckets of consumers, which are defined below. Your actual set
of authorizations **MAY** differ and you **SHOULD NOT** rely on the information
listed here under *Types of consumers*. Instead, rely on the documentation,
error codes and the `Allow` header.
