## Giving trailers new meaning.
Moviegoers absolutely enjoy trailers that play before the main feature but it's no surprise to understand why people forget those trailers hours or days later.

No more. TrailerVote's software plugs into your mobile app to identify the trailers being played on the big screen, prompts the user if they want to see it, and sends them a reminder to open your app to buy a ticket to that movie.

## The average cinema shows 8.4 trailers before the feature film.
We observed that moviegoers heavily used their phones before the movie and later would discuss each trailer after each played on the big screen. Another major finding was moviegoers had poor recall or needed prompting. These insights and observations are what drove our team to create TrailerVote.
